## Introduction 
PollCraft is a modern, real-time web application designed for creating, sharing, and participating in live polls. 

## Key Features 
* Effortless Poll Creation: A clean, simple form on the homepage allows anyone to create a poll with multiple options in seconds.
* Instant Sharable Links: Upon creation, a unique link is generated for the poll, which can be easily copied and shared. This link leads directly to a dedicated voting page.
* Live Voting & Results: Vote counts and result bars update in real-time for all connected users the moment a vote is cast.
* One Vote Per Device: An anonymous system prevents users from voting multiple times on the same poll from the same device.
* Creator-Controlled Settings:
* Timed Polls: Creators can set an automatic expiration timer (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour), after which the poll is automatically deleted from the database to keep the system clean.
* Hidden Results: Creators can choose to hide the results from voters, showing only a "Tama kana" message after a vote is cast, perfect for creating suspense.
* Dynamic & Polished UI:
* Light & Dark Modes: A theme toggle allows users to switch between a dark mode and a light mode, with the application remembering their preference.
* Animated Background: A subtle, interactive particle background adds visual flair and a modern feel.
* Fully Responsive: The entire interface is designed to work seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
